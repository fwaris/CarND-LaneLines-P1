**Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
==================================

### Reflection
This project contains a pipline for taking a color image (view of the road ahead)
and creating a modified image that shows the lane edges by projecting two lines
on to the identified lane left and right lane markers.

The pipline is applied to a series of test images and views. The output of the pipline are stored in the [/test_images_output/]
and [/test_videos_output/] folders



The project transform images by projecting a marker onto 
the lanes markings identified 

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...
